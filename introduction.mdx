## What is PulsejetDB?

PulsejetDB is vector storage where you can use it for both **rapid prototyping** and also **enterprise grade deployment**
with a simple lift-and-shift approach.
We want you to spend more time on building, rather spending time on setting up the infrastructure.

We are committed to make **high-performance database system** with persistence as it's first class citizen.
In addition to all, we provide various index types and custom indexes developed in-house for your workloads.

At this time of writing, we are developing our own index for your vector operations to have a balanced triple of:
* Search Accuracy
* Vector Compression
* Search Speed

## Use Cases

Common applications of PulsejetDB include AI and LLM use cases, machine learning use cases, and more. See a complete list with links below.
