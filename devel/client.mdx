After installing and importing client in the code. Now it is time for to start and connect to `local` instance.

```python Create the client
client = pj.PulsejetClient(location="local")
```

Above command will launch pulsejet in the background, and connect to it.

Since we will insert some vectors into our storage. We will build `VectorParams` which are indicating our
vector configuration for our collection.

```python Build vector configuration for our collection
vector_params = pj.VectorParams(size=128, index_type=pj.IndexType.HNSW)
```

In the above example, `size` indicates the vector size, and `index_type` is 
one of the possible indexes that we have documented at [Index Types](/features/index_types).

Let's start with `HNSW` for now.

As a next step let's create a collection. Collections are like tables for us.
They allow us to organize vectors and their indexes into same location for data locality.
You can learn more with [storage system doc](design/storage).

```python Create collection
client.create_collection("sift1m", vector_params)
```

Now we can take a look to existing collections in this list:
