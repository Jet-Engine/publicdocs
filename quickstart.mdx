Before we start, there are three ways to install PulsejetDB:
* Locally as a [Python package from PyPi](/devel/client). This is local installation and meant to be used for rapid prototyping.
* Remote as a [Docker](/setup/self-hosted/docker)
* Cloud with:
  * Self-hosting with AWS Marketplace (Upcoming)
  * Self-hosting with Google Marketplace (Upcoming)


## Client Interface

Regardless of you will do rapid prototyping or use remote instance to develop your production grade models, you need to install PulsejetDB python package.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="python" title="Install Python package">
    Create a virtualenv or in activated virtualenv, issue this command:
    ```bash
    pip install pulsejet
    ```
    We are making builds for these architectures for local package:
    * Linux x86_64
    * MacOS Aarch64

    For people who will always use Remote Installation, we will provide also thin client.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="arrow-up-to-arc" title="Import Pulsejet">
    Import Pulsejet in your Python code like:
    ```python
    import pulsejet as pj
    ```
    Now you are ready to go to work with either `local` installation or `remote` installation.

    **Choosing Local?**
    <Tip>Now you are ready to jump to [Python Package](/devel/client) setup.</Tip>
    **Choosing Remote?**
    <Tip>Head to [Docker-based](/setup/self-hosted/docker) setup.</Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

After following the steps above you are ready to start using PulsejetDB for RAG development, or for production integration use cases.
