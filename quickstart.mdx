Let's first install the database client. Client communicates with GRPC with Pulsejet.

## Client Interface

Below you can find the way to install the pulsejet client.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="python" title="Install Python package">
    Create a virtualenv or in activated virtualenv, issue this command:
    ```bash
    pip install pulsejet-client
    ```

    For people who will always use Remote Installation, we will provide also thin client.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="arrow-down-to-arc" title="Import Pulsejet">
    Import Pulsejet in your Python code like:
    ```python
    import pulsejet_client as pj
    ```
    Now you are ready to go to work with database after running the docker image, or if you are using Pulsejet Cloud or any cloud installation.

    **Run the database**
    <Tip>Head to [Docker-based](/setup/self-hosted/docker) setup.</Tip>

    <Note>
      Client comes in two flavors `sync` or `async` client.
