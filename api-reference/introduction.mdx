PulsejetDB provides REST API endpoints for **testing** and **trying** purposes.

<Warning>REST API isn't meant for performance oriented use cases.</Warning>

This section introduces REST API endpoints provided by PulsejetDB to operate on vectors.

Follow these steps to get started:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set up the development environment">
    Learn more about [installation here](/setup/self-hosted). 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect to a local or remote instance.">
    Connect your Pulsejet Instance via [local](/setup/self-hosted/python) or [remote](/setup/self-hosted/docker).<br></br>
    Use `Async` or `Sync` client to connect to your database.<br></br>
    Please check the [client documentation](/devel/client).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Insert & Search everything">
    You can search concurrently at the same time for multiple collections and multiple different indexes to harmonize your output.
    Take a look at the possible [Search Operations](/api-reference/search) to find the most suitable approach for you.
