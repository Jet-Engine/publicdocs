We will all configuration options for Pulsejet here.

Pulsejet mainly configurable with `config.toml` file.

Before proceeding, if you feel alien to terminology, please check the [terminology, design & concepts](/design).

Example config toml is below:

```toml
rest_api_port = 47044
grpc_api_port = 47045

[storage]
prod_name = "pulsejetdb"
shard_id = 0
basedir = ".database"

[storage.hot_config]
hot_storage_size = 10000000
bloom_fp_rate = 0.001
bloom_size = 1000000
flush_size = 52428800
bufferpool_to_resident_ratio = 0.2
resident_writeback_interval_ms = 50000
txn_timeout_ms = 500

[storage.warm_config]
max_background_jobs = 10
wal_check_checksum = true
wal_checkpoint_segments = 3
wal_checkpoint_timeout_seconds = 300
wal_log_gc_seconds = 3600
wal_log_gc_percentage = 0.2

[storage.cold_config]
cold_enable = false
writeback_frequency_secs = 300
concurrent_requests = 100
bucket_name = "pulsejet_cold"
cloud_api = "GCP"
base_path = "snapshots"
```

Let's explain the configuration options.

## Ports

There are two APIs, one is HTTP the other is GRPC.
GRPC used for performance queries.

```toml
rest_api_port = 47044
grpc_api_port = 47045
```

## Storage

This section configures the storage options of this server.

```toml
[storage]
prod_name = "pulsejetdb"
shard_id = 0
basedir = ".database"
```

* `prod_name`: Indicates the name of this instance. If you want to give a naming or advertise the instance with a name you can change this.
* `shard_id`: This is both shard and node id. For single node cluster it can stay as 0. But for other instance you need to change it to identify the shards.
    * If shard id is left zero in cluster mode, cluster will automatically recon and name the nodes in consistent hashing method.
* `basedir`: This is the directory where all data will be stored. By default it is local directory of `.database/`.

## Hot Storage

Pulsejet consists of hot, warm and cold storage tiers. This config is for hot storage (in-memory) config.

```toml
[storage.hot_config]
hot_storage_size = 10000000
bloom_fp_rate = 0.001
bloom_size = 1000000
flush_size = 52428800
bufferpool_to_resident_ratio = 0.2
resident_writeback_interval_ms = 50000
txn_timeout_ms = 500
```

* `hot_storage_size`: The amount of in-memory embeds that can be left in memory.
* `bloom_fp_rate`: False-positive rate of the bloom-filter to be used to find related embeds.
* `bloom_size`: Bloom filter size in general.
* `flush_size`: Flush size of the hot to warm storage. Keeping it bigger than `hot_storage_size` will make it flush to disk in a single shot.
* `bufferpool_to_resident_ratio`: How many embeds can be in the pre-buffer before goes into hot storage. For the example above it is `10000000 * 0.2`.
* `resident_writeback_interval_ms`: How frequently hot storage will be committed to warm (on-disk).
* `txn_timeout_ms`: Transactional commit timeout in milliseconds.

## Warm Storage

This is local mounted disk storage and it's configuration.

```toml
[storage.warm_config]
max_background_jobs = 10
wal_check_checksum = true
wal_checkpoint_segments = 3
wal_checkpoint_timeout_seconds = 300
wal_log_gc_seconds = 3600
wal_log_gc_percentage = 0.2
```

* `max_background_jobs`: How many background jobs to be used to writeback to disk.
* `wal_check_checksum`: For WAL do we need to check the checksum on load.
* `wal_checkpoint_segments`: Segment size per WAL log block.
* `wal_checkpoint_timeout_seconds`: How frequently checkpointing should be made.
* `wal_log_gc_seconds`: How frequently WAL GC needs to run.
* `wal_log_gc_percentage`: Percentage of the GCed and resident WAL records. How much of them should be GCed is configurable by this.

## Cold Storage

This is long term archival storage system. It is for writing data to object storages.

```toml
[storage.cold_config]
cold_enable = false
writeback_frequency_secs = 300
concurrent_requests = 100
bucket_name = "pulsejet_cold"
cloud_api = "GCP"
base_path = "snapshots"
```

* `cold_enable`: Enable cold storage, this is the switch for it.
* `writeback_frequency_secs`: How frequently we should write to object storage periodically.
* `concurrent_requests`: How many concurrent write operation can go simultaneously.
* `bucket_name`: Name of the bucket, `bucket` terminology can differ from one provider to another but the core model remains same.
* `cloud_api`: Which cloud API to use. Possible options are:
    * `GCP` for Google Cloud Storage.
    * `AWS` for AWS S3.
    * `Azure` for Azure Storage Blob.
* `base_path`: The path that will be following the `bucket_name` that we will write the data into.
